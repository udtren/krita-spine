## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Export now creates a nested `parentGroupName/activeGroupName` folder structure
  inside the export folder instead of a single `parentGroupName_activeGroupName`
  folder. The Spine JSON is written as `activeGroupName.json`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- Group-based export workflow: the active group layer defines the export name as
  `parentGroupName_activeGroupName` (layer tags stripped), falling back to just
  the active group name when it has no group parent.
- Export dialog now asks only for an **export folder**. The plugin automatically
  creates a `<combined name>` subfolder containing `<combined name>.json` and an
  `images` folder.

### Changed
- Hidden layers, and layers inside hidden groups, are now always ignored during
  export. Only visible layers are checked and exported.

### Removed
- Removed the "Ignore hidden layers" option and checkbox; hidden-layer filtering
  is now always on.

### Fixed
- Export is cancelled with a clear message when the active node is not a group
  layer, prompting the user to change the active node.
